    1.what is emmet?
     Emmet is the essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded 
     into full pieces of code for writing HTML and CSS, based on an abbreviation structure
      most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

    2.What is difference between react.development.js and react.dom.js files via CDN?
    react.development is the core of react whereas react.dom is to modify dom as we can see react is used in
    mobile too... react native
